# LensMove

Think of the horizontal line as the optical axis and the vertical line as the lens plane. 
If there is an object at the position of the red arrow that moves with the mouse, 
the image of the object will be formed at the position of the blue arrow. 
On the optical axis, there are pink dots at the focal points and the "twice focal points" of the lens. 
If the object is placed at the "twice focal point", a real image of the object is formed on the other side at the same distance with the same size.
